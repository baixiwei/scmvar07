 <strong>Learning About Science</strong></p>\

 <span style="font-size:11px;">IRB Study #0801000097 (05-9550)</span></p>\
<p style="text-align: center;">\
 <span style="font-size:11px;">Form date: December 28, 2012</span></p>\

 <span style="font-size:11px;"><strong>IRB Approval Date: </strong>Jan 4, 2013</span></p>\

 <span style="font-size:11px;"><strong>Expiration Date: </strong>Jan 3, 2015</span></p>\
<p>\
 You are invited to participate in a research study of how people learn scientific principles. You were selected as a possible subject because you indicated that you wished to participate on this website. We ask that you read this form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to be in the study.</p>\
<p>\
 The study is being conducted by Dr. Robert Goldstone in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences.</p>\
<p>\
 <strong>STUDY PURPOSE: </strong>Science education is vital for developing general critical thinking skills and preparation for a wide variety of careers. However, many students have great difficulty acquiring scientific knowledge, and have particular difficulty applying their knowledge to new cases. The purpose of this study is to better understand how people acquire scientific knowledge and use it in new situations.</p>\
<p>\
 <strong>NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE STUDY: </strong>If you agree to participate, you will be one of approximately 6,000 subjects who will be participating in this research.</p>\
<p>\
 <strong>PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY: </strong>If you agree to be in the study, you will be presented with several straightforward tasks to complete. These tasks will include interacting with graphical simulations of physical systems, and reading and entering text information. Each task will be related to a meaningful scientific principle. The entire session should take approximately 55 minutes.  You may only participate in the experiment once.</p>\
<p>\
 <strong>RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY: </strong>There is the risk of loss of confidentiality.</p>\
<p>\
 <strong>BENEFITS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY: </strong>An understanding of how individuals learn scientific principles can help us understand human learning, memory, and reasoning, and help educators to convey scientific information more effectively. You benefit from this experience because you learn something about how an experiment is designed and conducted, what issues are of interest to cognitive scientists, and how the mind acquires and uses scientific knowledge.</p>\
<p>\
 <strong>ALTERNATIVES TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY: </strong>Instead of being in the study, you have these options: Not being in the study.</p>\
<p>\
 <strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>: Efforts will be made to keep your personal information confidential. We cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. Your personal information may be disclosed if required by law. Your identity will be held in confidence in reports in which the study may be published and in databases in which results may be stored.</p><p>Organizations that may inspect and/or copy your research records for quality assurance and data analysis include groups such as the study investigator and his/her research associates, the IU Institutional Review Board or its designees, and (as allowed by law) state or federal agencies, specifically the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).</p>\
<p>\
 <strong>PAYMENT: </strong>For participating in this study, you will receive a small payment of $0.50.<br></p>\
<p>\
 <strong>CONTACTS FOR QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS: </strong>For questions about the study or a research-related injury, contact the researcher Dr. Robert Goldstone at 812-855-4853, or rgoldsto@indiana.edu.</p>\

 For questions about your rights as a research participant or to discuss problems, complaints or concerns about a research study, or to obtain information, or offer input, contact the IU Human Subjects office at (812) 856-4242 or by email at irb@iu.edu.</p>\
<p>\
 <strong>VOLUNTARY NATURE OF STUDY: </strong>Taking part in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to take part or may leave the study at any time. Leaving the study will not result in any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your current or future relations with the investigator(s).</p>\

var debriefing  = '<p>The experiment in which you just participated explores the effectiveness of different methods of learning and teaching mathematics. A critical issue in mathematics education is how to promote "transfer," i.e. applying what one has learned to novel situations outside the classroom.</p>\
<p>In principle, mathematical ideas are applicable to a wide range of problems in a variety of fields, making transfer particularly desirable. In practice, however, superficial differences between studied problems and newly encountered problems may conceal their shared mathematical structure, thus inhibiting transfer. A possible method of avoiding this difficulty would be to systematically vary the superficial characteristics of studied problems, while keeping their mathematical structure constant. Hopefully, this approach would encourage learners to focus on mathematical structure rather than superficial characteristics, thus leading to more transfer.</p>\
<p>This experiment involved various combinatorics problems. All shared the same mathematical structure: that of a Sampling with Replacement problem. You received instruction in how to solve such problems, in the form of a series of worked examples. In these examples, some types of things, such as locations, either "switched roles" between different examples, or always played the same roles throughout. You were then tested on problems involving several new types of situation. We hypothesize that the "switched roles" examples will lead to better test performance than the "constant roles" examples.</p>\
<p>Mathematics education in the USA is famously in need of reform. Inability to transfer knowledge learned to new problems is among the key issues to be resolved. We hope that our research will contribute to this reform by clarifying how the type of examples used to illustrate mathematical principles can affect the likelihood of successful knowledge transfer.</p>\
<p>We greatly appreciate your help in this research, which would not be possible without your effort. If you have any questions, or would like a more complete debriefing, please contact David Braithwaite at dwbraith@indiana.edu.</p>';
