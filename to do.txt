Counterbalance order of problems and of answers within each condition by consulting database

Make it retrieve condition and subcondition if already assigned? Or something. Currently it will assign subcondition whenever the page is opened, which will means turkers get assigned once on view and again on accept, which is not what we want!

Add check exclusion

Add alert window when HIT is inactive and/or fix randomization after accept and/or don't display randomized content

Revise problem layout
Record numbers
Re-order questions in data
Change database password and remove from github
